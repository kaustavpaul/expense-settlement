## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Module not found" errors:**
- Make sure the virtual environment is activated
- Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` again

**Port already in use:**
- The app uses port 8501 by default
- If busy, Streamlit will automatically try the next available port

**Permission denied (macOS/Linux):**
- Make shell scripts executable: `chmod +x run_app.sh setup_macos.sh`

**Python not found:**
- Ensure Python 3.8+ is installed and in your PATH
- On macOS/Linux, you might need to use `python3` instead of `python`

### Getting Help

- Check the built-in help section in the app sidebar
- Review the `HELP.md` file for detailed usage instructions
- Ensure all dependencies are properly installed

## 🔄 Portability

This app is designed to be portable across different machines and operating systems:

- **Virtual Environment**: All dependencies are isolated
- **Platform-Specific Launchers**: Easy startup on any OS
- **Consistent Experience**: Same functionality everywhere
- **Easy Transfer**: Copy the project folder (excluding `venv/`) to any machine
