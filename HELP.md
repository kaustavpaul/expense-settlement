# ❓ How to Use the Expense Settlement App

Welcome to the Expense Settlement App! This guide will walk you through all the features to help you manage and settle group expenses easily.

## 🚀 Getting Started

The app is divided into a **sidebar** for configuration and a **main area** for entering and viewing data.

---

## 👥 1. Configure People (Sidebar)

Before you can add expenses, you need to tell the app who is involved.

### Payer Names
-   **What it is**: A list of all the people who might pay for an expense.
-   **How to use**: Enter each person's name, separated by a comma.
-   **Example**: `Alice, Bob, Charlie`

### Participant Names
-   **What it is**: A list of all the people who might participate in (and therefore owe money for) an expense. This list can be the same as the payers or include additional people.
-   **How to use**: Enter each person's name, separated by a comma.
-   **Example**: `Alice, Bob, Charlie, David, Eve`

The app will automatically create dropdown menus based on these lists, making data entry fast and consistent.

## 💣 2. Reset App (Sidebar)

-   If you want to start completely fresh, click the **Reset App** button.
-   **Warning**: This is a destructive action and will clear everything: all names, all entered expenses, and any calculated results.

---

## 📝 3. Add a New Expense (Main Area)

This is where you'll spend most of your time.

### Expense Sharing
First, decide how many ways the expense will be split.
-   Click **➕ Add Participant** to add a new person to the expense form.
-   Click **➖ Remove Participant** to remove the last person from the form.
-   The **Sharing Between 'n' participants** metric shows you how many people are currently set to share the cost.

### Expense Details
Fill out the compact form for each expense:
-   **Expense Type**: A short description (e.g., "Dinner", "Groceries", "Movie Tickets").
-   **Amount**: The total cost of the expense (e.g., `25.50`).
-   **Payer**: Select the person who paid for this expense from the dropdown menu.

### Participants
This is where you specify who was part of the expense.
-   **Participant Name**: For each slot, select a person from the dropdown.
-   **Count**: This is the "head count". If a single participant entry represents more than one person (e.g., a couple or a family), you can set the count accordingly.
    -   **Example**: If "Alice" represents herself and a guest, you would select "Alice" and set her count to `2`.

Once the form is complete, click the green **Add Expense** button. The expense will appear in the "Entered Expenses" table below.

## 🧾 4. View and Manage Entered Expenses

This table shows a read-only list of all the expenses you've added.

### Deleting an Expense
If you make a mistake, you can easily delete an entry:
1.  Check the **Delete** box next to the row(s) you want to remove.
2.  A red **Delete selected expense(s)** button will appear. Click it to confirm the deletion.

## 📈 5. Understand the Live Financial Summary

This powerful table updates in real-time as you add or remove expenses. It gives you an at-a-glance overview of the financial situation.
-   **Total Paid**: The sum of all money paid by each person.
-   **Total Owed**: The total share of all expenses for each person.
-   **Difference**: The most important row.
    -   A **positive** number means that person is owed money.
    -   A **negative** number (in red) means that person owes money.
-   **Check**: This is a verification column. The totals here should always be zero (or very close to it), confirming that the money in and money out are balanced.

## 💳 6. Calculate the Final Settlement

Once all expenses are entered, you can generate the final payment plan.

1.  Click the green **✅ Calculate Settlement** button.
2.  A **Settlement Plan** will appear, showing you the simplest way for everyone to clear their debts (e.g., "Charlie pays Alice: $15.50").
3.  To hide the plan, click the **🗑️ Reset Calculation** button. This does not delete any of your data; it only hides the settlement plan.
